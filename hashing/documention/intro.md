# Hashing is not useful for
1. Finding closet value  
2. Sorted data
3. Prefix Searching

###  For 1 and 2 AVL and Red black trees preferred
### For prefix searching Trie data structure preferred

# Advantage of hashing
### Search , delete and Insert Operation performed in the O(1) Operation



# Hashing Application

1. Used as dictionary (key - value pair)
2. Database indexing 
3. Cryptography
4. Caches
5. Symbol tables in compiler / interpreters
6. Routers
7. Getting data from databases

# Direct Address Table

Sure! In a direct address table, instead of using a hash function to calculate an index based on a key, each key is associated with a unique index directly. This means that when you want to access a value, you can simply look up the corresponding index in the table.
