# Open Addressing 

<strong>Points to Remember</strong> 

    1. No of slots in hash table >= No of keys to be inserted
    2. Cache friendly
    3. Open addressing uses only single array to store the set of keys

# Ways of hashing

    1. Linear probing hashing
    2. Quadratic hashing
    3. Double hashing
